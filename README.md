## RSC IT ALL
gotta have it all:
- [go](https://go.dev/doc/install) - to run go
- [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air#installation) - to watch go files
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) - to run tailwind/watch views files

_you can have it all_

in the directory:
```
# tailwind things
npm i
npm run build
# tailwind watch /views
npm run watch

# go watch go
air
```
