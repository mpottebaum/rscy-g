## RSC IT ALL
gotta have it all:
- [go](https://go.dev/doc/install) - to run go
- [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air#installation) - to watch go files
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) - to run tailwind/watch views files

_you can have it all_

in the directory:
```
# tailwind setup things
npm install
npm run build

# tailwind watch /views dir
npm run watch
```

meanwhile in another shell...
start er up:
```
# air watch go code
air
```

we're watching files and rebuilding and shit but we're not reloading it in the browser yet ok sorry you're gonna have to do that yourself for now my bad
